> Show: HttpLazy – A Modern, Universal HTTP Client for TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js & Browser)

**Body:**
Hi everyone!

I just released [HttpLazy](https://github.com/mauroociappinaph/lazyhttp-libreria), a modern, lightweight, and fully-typed HTTP client for TypeScript/JavaScript. It works seamlessly in both Node.js and browser environments, and aims to be a robust alternative to Axios and Fetch, with advanced features out of the box:

- Unified API for all HTTP operations
- Built-in error handling, retries, and interceptors
- Smart cache (memory, localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Authentication (JWT, OAuth2) and metrics
- Modular, tree-shakable, and extensible
- Full TypeScript support

**Why another HTTP client?**
I wanted something minimal, universal, and easy to extend, with a predictable `{ data, error, status }` response pattern and no boilerplate.

**Docs & Examples:**

- [GitHub](https://github.com/mauroociappinaph/lazyhttp-libreria)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/httplazy)

**Looking for feedback!**

- Would you use this in your projects?
- What features or improvements would you like to see?
- Any issues or edge cases you want to test?

Feel free to try it out and let me know your thoughts!
